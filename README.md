# Solution to Advanced Lane Finding Project.
- Advanced Lane Finding Project.pdf explains the methodology used and contains illustrative examples. 
- AdvancedLaneFinding - Exploration.ipynb. This notebook contains an exploration of algorithms.
- AdvancedLaneFinding.ipynb. This notebook contains the processing pipeline with all algorithms for the lane finding.
- Folder output_images contains processed test images.  Files undistorted_XXX.jpg shows undistorted checker board and lane images. Files perspective_xxx.jpg shows lane images after perspective transformation, files pipeline0_XXX.jpg shows lane images after preprocessing and perspective transformation, files fitted_XXX demonstrates the histogram/sliding window method applied to lane images with the window bounding boxes and the fitted lines, files lane_detect_XXX shows the detected lanes with curvature and car position for the test images.
